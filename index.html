            <p>We believe we have completed everything in the requirements. Our smoke is realistic, and it speeds up and slows down depending on the slider value. Our house is creative and 3-dimensional.</p>
            <p>We wanted to change the color of the smoke as it rose up. But unfortunately were unable to implement it. We decided to get the smoke just right instead of focusing too much on color changes.</p>
            <p>Major challenges were debugging JavaScript. It was very frustrating to debug JavaScript, and we even had to use the debugging tools in Chrome a couple of times.</p>
